🛠️ Tech Stack

Solidity – Smart contract

Ethereum / EVM chain – Blockchain

Ethers.js – Blockchain interaction

HTML / CSS / JavaScript – Frontend

Vercel – Frontend deployment

MetaMask – Wallet connection



🔐 Who is the Admin?

The admin is the wallet address that deploys the smart contract.

This address has permission to:

Create proposals

Set voting duration

Admin is stored on-chain during deployment

👉 Only the deployer wallet becomes admin

🧑‍💼 How to Become Admin (Step-by-Step)
1️⃣ Deploy the Smart Contract

Open Remix IDE

Upload VoteChain.sol

Compile the contract

Deploy using MetaMask

Copy the contract address

⚠️ The wallet used here becomes the admin

2️⃣ Update Frontend Contract Details

In app.js, update:

const contractAddress = "YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS";


And ensure ABI is correct.

3️⃣ Open Admin Page

Open admin.html

Connect MetaMask using the admin wallet

You can now:

Create proposals

Set voting time

If a non-admin wallet connects, admin actions will fail.

👤 How Users Can Vote

Open index.html

Connect MetaMask

View active proposals

Vote YES or NO

Results are stored on-chain
